# carona
### previously octobot
octobot sounded stupid so i renamed my bot carona and im actually gonna put some stuff here soon

the bot originally was just experimental and the command system was extremely clunky (as all the commands were in the BotListener class) but recently i made the command base much more robust and added a few commands to use

ill put more stuff in this readme later
